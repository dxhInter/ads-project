/***
 * ReservationHeap: Implement Binary Min-heap for managing book reservations and waitlists for
 * the book ordered by the patronâ€™s priority which is an integer. (Priority 1 has precedence over
 * Priority 2 and so on). Ties need be broken by considering the timestamp at which the reservation
 * was made (first came and first served basis). Every node of the Min-heap should contain (patronID,
 * priorityNumber, timeOfReservation)
 * Note*:
 * - Assume that each waitlist is limited to 20.
 * - While taking timestamps, ensure the precision is high enough
